# Lena Lawson Bridal Lookbook
Built for a UK-based bridal studio, I was asked to select a simplistic design and add calendar integration to the client's existing system.

## Overview:

Tech used: JavaScript, CSS, & HTML

The goal for this project was simplicity.  The client opted for a one-page, responsive website that could be easily updated with new looks as bridal seasons changed. 


## Challenges:

Not all images were sized to fit on an equal scale, but I could fix this by pre-sizing files before uploading, then scaling minimally using CSS.
