# Lena Lawson 
This is one of my first freelance projects, built for a UK-based bridal studio.  I was asked to select a simplistic design and add an appointment-booking capability to the client's existing Calendly account.

## Overview:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The goal for this project was simplicity.  The client opted for a one-page, responsive website that could be easily updated with new looks as bridal seasons changed. 


## Challenges:

Not all images were sized to fit on equal scale but I was able to fix this by presizing files prior to upload, then scaling minimally using CSS.
